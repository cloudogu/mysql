# - innodb_log_file_size
# - innodb_flush_method
# - innodb_thread_sleep_delay

# starting with MariaDB 10.4.4 the working set in innodb_buffer_pool_size should take up to 80 % of the memory
# but at least 512 MB should be used (recommended settings vary from 2 to 16 GB depending on the actual DB server load)
