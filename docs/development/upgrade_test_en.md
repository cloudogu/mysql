# Upgrade Tests

In order to be able to test the Dogus update mechanism, the "itz-bund/easyredmine" Dogu can/should also be installed.

The database created by easyredmine contains several tables and certain database users and schemas, which are extracted by the upgrade script and reimported in the new version.
